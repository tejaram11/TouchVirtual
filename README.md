** NOTE **: if any problem arise while running the project , "handtest" file can be run individually which contains the whole project                                                                               #TOUCH VIRTUAL

PROBLEM STATEMENT :-

To develop artificial intelligence based computer program that can provide input to the computer systems 
by using hand a pointing device on any surface just like moving fingers on laptop touchpad.

Description :-

AS COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO DEVOLOP,PEOPLE HAVE SMALLER ELECTRONIC DEVICES.
INCREASINGLY WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN COMPUTING INTERACTIONS(HCI), AND INPARTICULAR VISION-BASED GESTURE AND OBJECT RECOGNITION.
IN THIS PROJECT,I PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH THAT USES A VIEDO DEVICE TO CONTROL THE MOUSE SYSYTEM(MOUSE TASKS).
Touch virtual- a computer vision based project aimed at converting any surface area into touch enabled input method for computer systems. 
The project uses the computer vision based technologies like OpenCV MediaPipe and pyAutoGUI for hand detection Coordinates processing and 
interfacing actions into the computer system. The project is solution to use the surface with a region of interest leveraged with the on 
board processing through computer vision model for the webcam video stream thus eliminating additional hardware requirements. 
The project can be used in a setting at the time of presentation where the user need not to move into the computer to provide input as 
they can indicate the input action directly by touching the part of the projected screen through the hand itself like dragging the 
mouse and typing which are captured by the webcam, processed by the model and sent to the system making it to record the input.

APPLICATION AND FUTURE WORK :-

Control of cursor and clicking action in various devices.
In the future, I plan to add more features such as enlarging and shrinking windows, closing window using palm gestures, keyboard interface for typing.

FLOW CHART :-

 Start--> Bounding box--> Image acquistion--> Hand detection--> coordinate extraction--> Event generation.

Advantages :-

.The main advantage of using hand gestures is to interact with computer as a non-contact human computer input modality.

.Reduce hardware cost by eliminating use of mouse.

.Convenient for users not comfortable with touchpad.

.The framework may be useful for controlling different types of games and other applications dependent on the controlled through user defined gestures.

Conclusion :-

I have developed a system to control the mouse cursor using a real-time camera.
This system is based on computer vision algorithms and can do all mouse tasks.
However, it is difficult to get stable results because of the variety of lighting and skin colors of human races.
This system could be useful in presentations and to reduce work space.
